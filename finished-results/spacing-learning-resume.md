# ResumeBuddy — Resumo Estruturado

## TL;DR (até 5 pontos)
- performance on final tests of learning is improved if multiple study sessions are separated—i.e., “spaced” apart—in time rather than massed in immediate succession
- understanding how the scheduling of study influences memory retention is critically important.
- Studying information across two or more sessions that are separated (i.e., spaced apart or distributed) in time often produces better learning than spending the same amount of time studying the material in a single session.
- the spacing effect is one of the oldest and most reliable findings in research on human learning.
- the optimal spacing gap depends on when the information will be tested in the future

## Abstract
- performance on final tests of learning is improved if multiple study sessions are separated—i.e., “spaced” apart—in time rather than massed in immediate succession

## Using Spacing
- understanding how the scheduling of study influences memory retention is critically important.

## The benefits of spaced study
- Studying information across two or more sessions that are separated (i.e., spaced apart or distributed) in time often produces better learning than spending the same amount of time studying the material in a single session.
- the spacing effect is one of the oldest and most reliable findings in research on human learning.
- spacing can also improve learning of information that is conceptually more difficult.

## surgical
- spacing effect was found

## How long should the spacing gap be?
- longer spacing gaps would benefit learning to an even greater degree
- the optimal spacing gap depends on when the information will be tested in the future

## However
- the longer the test delay, the longer the optimal spacing gap
- there is no “one-size-fits-all” approach to using spacing as a means of improving memory retention
- a longer spacing gap is not always better
- in order to pick the optimal timing of study sessions, students and instructors must decide when they expect to need the information
- if the goal is to retain information for just a short time, shorter spacing gaps may be ideal. However, if the goal is to achieve retention for much longer periods, spacing gaps of several weeks or months may be best. Indeed, for lifelong preservation of knowledge, spacing gaps of years may well be optimal
- Any form of spacing—whether it is fixed or expanding—appears to promote learning
- the present findings suggest that students and teachers do not need to be overly concerned about whether the spacing gaps that separate repeated study sessions are equal or not
- the ideal time to review information may be several weeks or months after it was initially learned

## Pedagogical recommendations and responses to potential challenges
- students should receive spaced re-exposure to previously-learned information
- it may be beneficial to review this information after a time period of at least several weeks
- instructors might incorporate into each lesson a brief review of concepts that were learned several weeks earlier
- homework assignments could be used to re-expose students to important information that they have learned previously
- instructors could give exams and quizzes that are cumulative
- cumulative exams and quizzes provide students with a good reason to review information on their own

## References
- instructors may find it necessary to supplement the information from any given lesson with examples from previous lessons
- Interleaving inherently provides spaced practice, and, no less importantly, it also provides students with an opportunity to choose the appropriate strategy for a given kind of problem, which students need not do when every problem concerns the same procedure or concept
- We have also attempted to shed some light on how the benefits of spaced practice might be implemented in everyday instruction

## Conceitos
- **spacing gap** — the time duration between successive presentations
- **test delay** — the time elapsed between the final study presentation and the test
- **massed** — the gap between presentations is zero
- **spaced or distributed** — presentations are separated by a nonzero time interval
- **spacing effect** — performance is most often better for items that were spaced rather than massed
- **lag effect** — different spacing gaps (i.e., lags) result in different degrees of learning
- **abscond** — to leave secretly and hide, often to avoid the law
