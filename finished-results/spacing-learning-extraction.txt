Abstract 
 
Every day students and instructors are faced with the decision of when to study information. The timing of study, and how 
it affects memory retention, has been explored for many years in research on human learning. This research has shown 
that performance on final tests of learning is improved if multiple study sessions are separated—i.e., “spaced” apart—in 
time rather than massed in immediate succession. In this article, we review research findings of the types of learning that 
benefit from spaced study, demonstrations of these benefits in educational settings, and recent research on the time 
intervals during which spaced study should occur in order to maximize memory retention. We conclude with a list of 
recommendations on how spacing might be incorporated into everyday instruction.

One fundamental decision that students and 

instructors must make is when to study information. If an 
exam is coming up next week, should students begin to 
review their notes today, or wait a few more days? Once 
instructors have presented information, how long should 
they wait before they review this information in order to 
increase the chances that students will retain it over 
summer break? Given that the intended outcome of such 
decisions is to promote durable learning, understanding 
how the scheduling of study influences memory retention 
is critically important.  

 
The benefits of spaced study  

Studying information across two or more sessions 
that are separated (i.e., spaced apart or distributed) in 
time often produces better learning than spending the 
same amount of time studying the material in a single 
session. Figure 1 illustrates the design of a typical study 
on this topic. This design includes: (1) multiple study 
sessions in which the same information (e.g., biology 
terms) is presented at least twice, (2) a manipulation of 
the time duration between successive presentations, 
which is referred to here as the spacing gap, and (3) a 
test delay that is defined as the time elapsed between 
the final study presentation and the test. The test delay 
can either be fixed or manipulated.  

When the spacing gap between two or more 
presentations of the same item is zero (e.g., the same 
biology term and definition is presented back-to-back 
with no interruptions in-between), the presentations are 
said to be massed together. When the gap between 
presentations is greater than zero (e.g., a given biology 
term is repeated every five minutes, or after five different 
biology terms have been presented), then the 
presentations are said to be spaced or distributed 
because they are separated by a nonzero time interval. 
The gap separating spaced presentations can range 
anywhere from a few seconds to several weeks, 
whereas the gap separating massed presentations is 
zero.  

On the final memory test, performance is most often 
better for items that were spaced rather than massed. 
This is typically referred to as the spacing effect. Some 
studies have also reported that different spacing gaps 
(i.e., lags) result in different degrees of learning, which 
has sometimes been referred to as the lag effect. For 
example, learning of a given biology term might be better 
when it is repeated after a relatively long spacing gap 
(e.g., five minutes) compared to a relatively short 
spacing gap (e.g., one minute). In the current paper, we 

use the term spacing effect in a general sense to refer to 
the different degrees of learning that result as a function 
of different spacing gaps.     

The spacing effect is one of the oldest and most 
reliable findings in research on human learning. Early 
demonstrations of this effect date back to over 100 years 
ago (e.g., see Ebbinghaus, 1885/1913), and hundreds of 
published studies have reported benefits of spacing (for 
a recent review, see Cepeda, Pashler, Vul, Wixted, & 
Rohrer, 2006). While participants in most of these 
studies were adult learners, the benefits of spacing have 
also been reliably demonstrated in studies with younger 
participants, including elementary school children (e.g., 
Toppino & DiGeorge, 1984), middle school children 
(e.g., Carpenter, Pashler, & Cepeda, 2009; Toppino & 
DeMesquita, 1984), and preschool children as young as 
three or four years of age (e.g., Rea & Modigliani, 1987; 
Toppino, 1991).  

The vast majority of studies on the spacing effect 
has been conducted in the laboratory, and these studies 
typically require participants to learn relatively simple 
types of verbal information such as word lists or trivia 
facts. Recently, however, new findings have emerged 
showing that spacing can also improve learning of 
information that is conceptually more difficult. For 
example, Bird (2010) found that longer spacing gaps 
improved English-learning adults’ understanding of 
subtle grammatical rules. Participants saw sentences 
such as “Albert Einstein has been a great 
mathematician,” and their task was to provide the 
corrected version, “Albert Einstein was a great 
mathematician.” Two practice sessions were separated 
by either three or 14 days, and the 14-day spacing gap 
produced superior scores to the three-day gap on tests 
given either seven or 60 days later. Spacing has also 
been shown to improve learning in other tasks that might 
be considered complex forms of learning, such as 
spelling (Fishman, Keller, & Atkinson, 1968), reading 
skills (e.g., Seabrook, Brown, & Solity, 2005), and 
biology (Reynolds & Glaser, 1964). 

Spacing effects were found in two recent 
experiments in which college students learned a 
moderately abstract mathematics task (Rohrer & Taylor, 
2006, 2007). The task required students to find the 
number of permutations of a sequence of items with at 
least one repeated item. For instance, the sequence 
abbccc has 60 permutations, including abaccc and 
abcbcc. In both studies, spacing boosted scores on a 
final test consisting of novel problems of the same kind. 
Figure 2 shows the results of one of these studies.

Benefits of spacing have also been reported for 
tasks involving coordinated motor skills. For instance, in 
a study reported by Moulton et al. (2006), surgical 
residents practiced microsurgical skills in four training 
sessions that were squeezed into the same day or 
distributed across four weeks. On a final test given one 
month after the last practice session, a spacing effect 
was found.    

Recent studies have shown that spacing can 
benefit learning in realistic educational contexts as well. 
In one study, Sobel, Cepeda, and Kapler (2011) 
investigated fifth-graders’ retention for the definitions of 
uncommon English words of the type that appear on the 
Graduate Record Examination (GRE) (e.g., abscond: to 
leave secretly and hide, often to avoid the law). These 
words were learned in class via a teacher-led tutorial 
that included slides, oral practice, and paper-and-pencil 
tests. Either immediately or one week after the first 
tutorial, students completed the same tutorial a second 
time, and were then given a final vocabulary test that 
required them to supply the definition for each word five 
weeks after completing the second tutorial. Memory on 
the five-week delayed test was superior for definitions 
learned with the seven-day spacing gap (20.8%) 
compared to the zero-day spacing gap (7.5%). This 
amount of forgetting might appear substantial, but 
previous research on forgetting of classroom material 
has demonstrated a similar level of forgetting over a 
similar time period (Jones, 1923; Tiedeman, 1948).  

 In a second study, Carpenter et al. (2009) 
explored how the timing of a review session affected 
retention of U. S. history facts that were learned by 
eighth grade students. After completing their course in 
U. S. history, students completed a review activity that 
involved answering several questions from the most 
recent unit that they studied (e.g., Who assassinated 
president Abraham Lincoln?). For each question, 
students were asked to write an answer (e.g., John 
Wilkes Booth), and then were given a sheet of answers 
to check their accuracy. One group of students 
completed the review one week after finishing the course 
(i.e., the Immediate Review Group), and another group 
completed the same review 16 weeks later, after 
returning from summer vacation (i.e., the Delayed 
Review Group). Students were tested over the 
information again nine months after completing the 
review. After such a substantial delay, it is not surprising 
that students forgot the majority of answers to these 
questions. The key finding, however, was that long-term 
retention was better for students who completed the 

delayed review than for those who completed the 
immediate review (12.2% vs. 8%, respectively).  

  Another demonstration of the benefits of 
spacing in the classroom was reported by Seabrook et 
al. (2005), who assessed first graders’ acquisition of 
reading skills. In their regular classrooms, all students 
received six minutes of instruction per day for two 
weeks. One group of students received this instruction 
within a single session lasting six minutes, while a 
second group received it across three separate two-
minute sessions that were administered at unspecified 
time intervals. A comparison of pretest and posttest 
scores revealed that the group experiencing the spaced 
two-minute sessions showed greater improvement in 
reading skills (an increase of 8.3 points), compared to 
the group experiencing the continuous six-minute 
session (an increase of only 1.3 points).  

 
How long should the spacing gap be? 

To use spacing as effectively as possible, it is 
important to know just how far apart the study sessions 
should be spaced. For instance, if medical professionals 
wish to maintain good retention of emergency response 
skills over a two-year period, is there an optimal time 
during which they should review these skills?  When 
learners must retain information over a given test delay, 
an important practical question to address is when 
repeated study of this information should take place.  

If spacing benefits learning, then a reasonable 
assumption might be that longer spacing gaps would 
benefit learning to an even greater degree. Indeed, 
some studies examining the effects of longer vs. shorter 
spacing gaps have typically found that longer spacing 
gaps are more beneficial for retention (e.g., Glenberg, 
1976; Hintzman, 1969, 1974; Melton, 1970). For 
example, Kahana and Howard (2005) found that 
retention of words was best when the words were 
repeated three times with six to 20 other words occurring 
between each of the three presentations, compared with 
only two to six other words occurring between each of 
the three presentations.   

Studies by Bahrick and colleagues examining long-
term retention appear to confirm the idea that longer 
spacing gaps produce better memory retention than 
shorter spacing gaps. In a study by Bahrick (1979), 
participants learned the English translations for several 
Spanish words by completing six learning sessions that 
were separated by a spacing gap of either zero days 
(i.e., all sessions occurred on the same day), one day, or 
30 days. All participants were given a final test one 
month after the last learning session. Performance on 



Using Spacing     4 
 

 

this test was best for the participants who learned the 
words with the 30-day spacing gap. A follow-up study 
revealed that retention of these words after eight years 
was still superior for the participants who experienced 
the 30-day spacing gap relative to the zero- or one-day 
spacing gap (Bahrick & Phelps, 1987).  

 However, reviews of the literature on spacing have 
revealed that an increase in the duration of the spacing 
gap does not always produce superior memory retention 
(e.g., Cepeda et al., 2009; Cepeda et al., 2006; Donovan 
& Radosevich, 1999; Glenberg, 1976; Verkoeijen, 
Rikers, & Özsoy, 2008). One potential danger of waiting 
too long before reviewing information is that students 
may forget much of what they have learned previously, 
and this forgetting may offset any benefits that would 
have occurred due to spacing. This suggests that there 
may be diminishing returns to increasing the spacing 
gap.  

What might the optimal spacing gap be? Answering 
this question requires a thorough comparison of the 
effects of different spacing gaps across a wide range of 
time intervals. In what was probably the most 
comprehensive study ever to explore this, Cepeda et al. 
(2008) gave adult learners a flashcard-like web tutorial in 
which they learned a set of obscure facts (e.g., Libya’s 
flag consists of a single solid color). During the first 
learning session, participants learned 32 of these facts 
until they could recall each of them successfully. Then, 
each participant completed a second learning session in 
which they were quizzed over each fact (e.g., what 
country’s flag consists of a single solid color?), and then 
shown the answer (e.g., Libya). Finally, each participant 
was given a final test over each fact in which they were 
shown this question again and asked to recall the 
answer. The spacing gap between the two learning 
sessions ranged across a half dozen values between 
zero and 105 days. For example, some participants 
completed the two learning sessions with a two-day 
spacing gap, others with a seven-day gap, and others 
with a 21-day gap. Following the second learning 
session, each participant completed the final test after a 
test delay of seven days, 35 days, 70 days, or 350 days. 
Each participant was randomly assigned to one of 26 
unique combinations of spacing gap and test delay.   

Figure 3 shows the proportion of facts correctly 
recalled on the final test as a function of spacing gap 
and test delay. The key finding from this study is that the 
optimal spacing gap depends on when the information 
will be tested in the future. For participants who 
completed the final test seven days after their final study 
session, the optimal spacing gap was one day. However, 

for participants who waited 35 days before taking the 
final test, the optimal spacing gap was 11 days. For 
those who completed the final test after 70 days, the 
best spacing gap was 21 days.  In general, the optimal 
spacing gap equaled 10% - 20% of the test delay. In 
other words, the longer the test delay, the longer the 
optimal spacing gap.  

This study demonstrates that there is no “one-size-
fits-all” approach to using spacing as a means of 
improving memory retention. Quite simply, a longer 
spacing gap is not always better. Instead, these findings 
suggest that in order to pick the optimal timing of study 
sessions, students and instructors must decide when 
they expect to need the information. If the goal is to 
retain information for just a short time, shorter spacing 
gaps may be ideal. However, if the goal is to achieve 
retention for much longer periods, spacing gaps of 
several weeks or months may be best. Indeed, for 
lifelong preservation of knowledge, spacing gaps of 
years may well be optimal. 

While the study by Cepeda et al. (2008) sought to 
determine the optimal duration of a spacing gap when 
learning is limited to only two sessions, numerous 
studies have addressed a related question: if learners 
encounter information in three or more sessions, should 
the spacing gaps be equal? Studies that have explored 
the effects of different spacing gaps with three or more 
learning sessions have typically compared two 
schedules of spacing: (1) a fixed schedule, in which all 
spacing gaps are identical (e.g., information is studied 
four times, with a 24-hour spacing gap separating each 
study session), or (2) an expanding schedule, in which 
the spacing gap becomes progressively longer (e.g., 
information is studied once, then again after 30 minutes, 
then a third time after 24 hours, and a fourth time after 
one week).  

Experiments comparing fixed and expanding 
schedules have produced equivocal results. Some 
studies have found that expanding schedules produce 
better learning than fixed schedules (e.g., Cull, 
Shaughnessy, & Zechmeister, 1996; Landauer & Bjork, 
1978), and others have found that expanding and fixed 
schedules produce similar levels of learning (e.g., 
Carpenter & DeLosh, 2005; Cull, 2000; Logan & Balota, 
2008; Pyc & Rawson, 2007; for a critical review of this 
literature, see Balota, Duchek, & Logan, 2007).  

Recent evidence suggests that expanding 
schedules might be better for short-term retention, and 
fixed schedules might be better for longer-term retention 
(Karpicke & Roediger, 2007). A comprehensive 
comparison of various spacing gaps and test delays 



Using Spacing     5 
 

 

involving three or more learning sessions has yet to be 
carried out, and until then it remains an open question 
whether the optimal spacing gaps for three or more 
learning sessions are critically dependent upon when the 
final test takes place.  

One finding appears to be reliable, however. Any 
form of spacing—whether it is fixed or expanding—
appears to promote learning. In studies comparing either 
a fixed or expanding schedule to a massed schedule in 
which three or more presentations of an item occur 
back-to-back in immediate succession, it has been 
consistently demonstrated that either type of spacing 
schedule produces better learning than a massed 
schedule (e.g., Carpenter & DeLosh, 2005; Cull, 2000; 
Rea & Modigliani, 1985).  

Thus, when faced with the practical question of 
when to review information, the present findings suggest 
that students and teachers do not need to be overly 
concerned about whether the spacing gaps that 
separate repeated study sessions are  equal or not. The 
key criterion is that information should be reviewed after 
a period of time has passed since the initial learning. 
Particularly if the goal is long-term retention, the findings 
from Cepeda et al. (2008) suggest that the ideal time to 
review information may be several weeks or months 
after it was initially learned.  

 
Pedagogical recommendations and responses to 
potential challenges 

Many researchers have urged teachers and 
curriculum designers to use spacing as an instructional 
strategy (e.g., Bahrick, 1979; Bjork, 1979; Dempster, 
1987, 1988, 1989; Halpern, 2008; Metcalfe, Kornell, & 
Son, 2007; Pashler, Rohrer, Cepeda, & Carpenter, 2007; 
Willingham, 2002). Unfortunately, however, spacing has 
yet to be systematically implemented in educational 
curricula (e.g., Cepeda, Vul, Rohrer, Wixted, & Pashler, 
2008; Dempster, 1988; Rohrer & Pashler, 2010). One 
reason for this could be that research on spacing has not 
produced a clear set of recommendations for how it can 
be used in everyday instruction. In this section, we 
describe some specific strategies that can be used by 
students and educators to capitalize on the advantages 
of spacing.  

The literature reviewed here suggests that in order 
to promote long-term retention of knowledge, students 
should receive spaced re-exposure to previously-learned 
information. Particularly if the goal is long-term retention, 
it may be beneficial to review this information after a time 
period of at least several weeks (e.g., Cepeda et al., 
2008). This review can take place in a number of ways. 

First, instructors might incorporate into each lesson a 
brief review of concepts that were learned several weeks 
earlier.  

Second, homework assignments could be used to 
re-expose students to important information that they 
have learned previously. This recommendation may be 
particularly useful when class time is limited and a 
review is difficult to fit in to the lesson on any given day. 
For example, an instructor could intentionally include 
questions covering information that was learned in class 
several weeks earlier.   

Third, instructors could give exams and quizzes that 
are cumulative. In addition to re-exposing students to 
information that they have previously learned, 
cumulative exams and quizzes provide students with a 
good reason to review information on their own. These 
three recommendations are not mutually exclusive, and 
like any guidelines, they are more likely to produce 
positive learning outcomes when used in conjunction 
with one another (for more on pedagogical 
recommendations involving spacing, see Pashler et al., 
2007).   

 These recommendations may sometimes be 
difficult to carry out. First, students often seem to be less 
than enthusiastic about cumulative exams. When the 
exam is cumulative, students may feel that there is more 
information that they must study. However, if students 
are provided with regular reviews of previously-learned 
information, this information is more likely to remain 
accessible in memory, reducing the need for them to re-
study old information that has already been forgotten. 

Second, instructors may be discouraged to find that 
after several weeks, students have forgotten much of the 
information that they had previously known. It is 
commonly the case that students forget a good deal of 
what they have learned, especially after lengthy time 
periods (e.g., Carpenter, Pashler, Wixted, & Vul, 2008; 
Dillon, 2008). Importantly, however, this is not an 
indication that the instruction was wholly futile. On the 
contrary, when students are re-exposed to information 
that they have learned but temporarily cannot recall, they 
acquire this information much faster than information 
that is being learned for the first time (e.g., Berger, Hall, 
& Bahrick, 1999; Ebbinghaus, 1885/1913; Nelson, 
1985). Thus, although forgetting is likely to be a 
necessary consequence of reviewing information after 
long spacing gaps, re-exposing students to this 
information on a regular basis will keep it accessible in 
memory and render it less vulnerable to forgetting over 
time.  



Using Spacing     6 
 

 

A final challenge that instructors might encounter in 
implementing spacing into learning curricula is the fact 
that educational materials appear to discourage this 
approach. In particular, many textbooks present 
information in a non-distributed fashion. For instance, 
although spacing has been known to improve foreign 
language learning (e.g., Bahrick, Bahrick, Bahrick, & 
Bahrick, 1993; Bahrick & Phelps, 1987; Bird, 2010; 
Bloom & Shuell, 1981), in most foreign language 
textbooks, the vocabulary of each chapter is devoted to 
a particular topic (e.g., food, clothing), and these words 
rarely appear in subsequent chapters. Likewise, in most 
mathematics textbooks, each set of problems is devoted 
to the most recent lesson. After learning about ratios, for 
example, students will work one or two dozen ratio 
problems.  

Because textbooks do not typically provide spaced 
exposure to concepts, in order to ensure that students 
receive this, instructors may find it necessary to 
supplement the information from any given lesson with 
examples from previous lessons. For example, in one 
rarely-used approach to mathematics learning, each 
lesson is followed by an interleaved set of examples 
from many different lessons. Interleaving inherently 
provides spaced practice, and, no less importantly, it 
also provides students with an opportunity to choose the 
appropriate strategy for a given kind of problem, which 
students need not do when every problem concerns the 
same procedure or concept (e.g., Rohrer, 2009; Taylor & 
Rohrer, 2010).  

In this review we have highlighted some key 
findings concerning the types of learning that benefit 
from spacing, demonstrations of spacing effects in 
educational settings, and explorations of the ideal 
spacing gap. We have also attempted to shed some light 
on how the benefits of spaced practice might be 
implemented in everyday instruction. We hope that this 
information can be of value to students and educators 
who are seeking ways of using spacing to maximize 
learning.

Figure 1. Design of a typical study on the spacing effect. Participants experience two learning sessions that are separated 
by an interval of time referred to here as the spacing gap. After another interval of time called the test delay, participants 
are given a final test over the information that they encountered in the two learning sessions.

Figure 2. A mathematics spacing experiment. College students observed a tutorial on how to solve an obscure kind of 
permutation problem before attempting 10 practice problems that were given in a single session (0-day spacing gap) or 
spaced across two sessions separated by one week (7-day spacing gap) (for full details, see Rohrer & Taylor, 2006). A 
test with novel problems of the same kind was given one or four weeks later. Spacing had no reliable effect on test scores 
after a one-week delay but doubled test scores after a four-week delay.

Figure 3. Proportion of facts recalled in the study by Cepeda et al. (2008) as a function of spacing gap (either 0, 1, 2, 4, 7, 
11, 14, 21, 35, 70, or 105 days) and test delay (either 7, 35, 70, or 350 days). The spacing gap that produced the highest 
level of recall was dependent upon the test delay, such that shorter spacing gaps (e.g., one day) were more beneficial for 
recall after a relatively short test delay (e.g., seven days), and longer spacing gaps (e.g., 21 days) were more beneficial 
for recall after a longer test delay (e.g., 70 days).
