## TL;DR (até 5 pontos)
- retrieval is the key process for understanding and for promoting learning
- Retrieval processes must be considered in any analysis of learning, and incorpo- rating retrieval into educational activities represents a powerful way to enhance learning.
- learning represents the ability to use past experi-ences in the service of the present
- Learning is therefore more than the encoding or construction of knowledge from experiences—it is the interaction between retrieval cues in the present and remnants of the past.
- retrieval is the key process for understanding learning and therefore must be considered in any analysis of learning

## Why Retrieval Is the Key to Understanding Learning
- Focusing on applied problems can reveal new questions that deserve theoretical exploration, while theoretical ideas can be tools to aid in the development of new applications.

## None
- Knowledge is constructed by learners who actively build knowledge structures
- people do not store copies of past experiences and reproduce them verbatim at the time of retrieval
- the knowledge a person expresses can vary greatly depending on the retrieval cues available in a particular context
- students recalled new information the second time that they had not recalled the first time
- The key lesson is that we can never directly examine what students have encoded, constructed, and stored from a learning experience
- understanding retrieval is essential for understanding learning

## The Process of Retrieval Influences Learning

> **Citações**
> “retrieval produces learning may be counterintuitive to some readers” — the idea

## the learning phase
- Repeatedly retrieving words during initial learning, which amounted to only two or three extra retrievals in this experiment, produced about a 150 % improvement in long- term retention

## the previous studies
- active retrieval produces direct effects on learning but, as we have noted, retrieval can also produce important indirect effects on learning

## the process of a retrieval attempt
- attempting retrieval early in the process of learning, even before a person would be able to successfully recall desired knowledge, will help learners encode knowledge during study episodes

## Practicing Retrieval Promotes Meaningful Learning

> **Citações**
> “meaningful learning” — the term

## meaningful” learning
- the distinction between rote and meaningful learning depends upon the similarity of present retrieval scenarios to past learning experiences
- the ability to accomplish the task depends on using retrieval cues to reconstruct knowledge
- Active retrieval has been shown to enhance learning of meaningful educa- tional materials, and it enhances learning on assessments designed to measure meaningful aspects of learning.
- engaging in active retrieval practice produced substantially greater long-term retention than did repeated reading
- more learning occurred during repeated retrieval than during repeated encoding
- practicing retrieval produced the best long-term retention as assessed by both verbatim and inference questions

## Metacognition and Self-Regulated Retrieval Practice
- active retrieval is effective for learning mean- ingful educational materials as measured on meaningful assessments of learning
- attempting retrieval improves learning by potentiating subsequent encoding, because the retrieval attempt helps the learner establish a search set that facilitates the encoding of new knowledge
- attempting retrieval by answering the pretest questions enhanced learning on final assessments both immediately after learning and after a week delay
- attempting retrieval of the pretest questions improved learning more than did merely reading the questions
- the process of attempting retrieval itself, rather than simply knowing particular relevant questions in advance, enhances subsequent encoding during reading
- attempting retrieval, even before students are capable of producing correct answers, facilitates learning of complex, meaningful materials, probably because the retrieval attempt helps the learner establish a search set that facilitates subsequent encoding
- students are not generally aware of the beneficial effects of active retrieval for learning
- students are not aware of the positive effects of active retrieval
- students’ judgments of learning are partially based on the fluency with which they process material
- active retrieval changes the information students use to make their judgments of learning. Now, judgments are based on the ease (or difficulty) with which material can be brought to mind during retrieval
- when students retrieved items easily during learning, their metacognitive judgments of their own learning were high, and this led students to remove items from practice rather than practicing retrieval, even though active retrieval would enhance learning
- learners ought to begin attempting retrieval early during the course of learning, because such retrieval attempts will help learners establish search sets that will aid the encoding of new informa- tion
- students tended to wait and attempt recall later in learning. As a consequence, the rate of learning was slower than it was when students attempted retrieval of all items throughout the course of learning, thus benefitting from the potentiating effects of retrieval on encoding

## Retrieval Practice in the Classroom
- practicing active reconstruction of knowledge is not something students typically do when they regulate their own learning
- many students do not recognize the benefits of practicing active retrieval and do not use it as a study strategy
- the benefits of engaging in retrieval in the classroom can be long-lasting
- low-stakes quizzing is an effective way to get students to practice active retrieval in the classroom
- attempting retrieval on a pretest enhances learning when it helps students create a search set into which they can incorporate new knowledge
- active retrieval promotes learning does not mean that instructors must include more tests and quizzes in the classroom
- There are many ways instructors could incorporate active retrieval into classroom learning activities, and no single method has been identified as the best method

## Conclusion
- Retrieval is more than merely an assessment of learning that occurred in a prior experience.
- The process of retrieval itself is central to creating learning, and it is always essential to consider the demands of a retrieval task in order to understand learning in any situation.
- a retrieval-based perspective on learning recognizes that retrieval is a powerful tool for improving learning.

## Conceitos
- **Meaningful learning** — learning of complex educational materials as assessed on measures of inference making and knowledge application
- **learning** — the ability to use past experi-ences in the service of the present
- **reappearance hypothesis** — knowledge and experiences are encoded and as- assumed to reappear in the mind when they are needed
- **trace-dependent theories** — performance was thought to reflect the status of memory traces created during encoding
- **indirect effect of retrieval** — retrieval enhances learning by virtue of some other mediating process
- **direct effects on learning** — engaging in the process of retrieval itself produces learning
- **rote learning** — brittle and transient
- **meaningful learning** — robust and enduring
- **concept mapping** — creating a diagram in which the concepts within some domain are represented as nodes and links connecting the nodes represent relations among the concepts
- **PUREMEM** — Practicing Unassisted Retrieval to Enhance Memory for Essential Material
- **QuickScore** — scores students’ responses while they practice retrieval and determines when particular concepts would benefit from additional retrieval practice
- **guided retrieval practice** — retrieval practice with QuickScore
