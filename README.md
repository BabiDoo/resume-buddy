# Resume Buddy

## Project Description

Resume Buddy is a tool that leverages artificial intelligence to generate summaries from text files or notes. The application converts PDFs to `.txt`, processes the content using the Gemini model, and organizes the results into a `.md` file, making it easier to review and manage information.
